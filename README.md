# Netflix Clone

This is a side project about a Netflix clone built in Next.js.

Purposes of this project:

- Have fun and experiment with new or interesting technology
- Play with the new app dir in Next.js v13
- Play with i18n
- I'd love to implement some nice CSS animations that Netflix uses

**Disclaimer**: This project isn't finished. I update/add new stuff whenever
I've got plenty of time to do so, which is almost never the case ðŸ¤£
