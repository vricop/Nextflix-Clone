# Netflix Clone

A Nextflix clone for education purposes. This is a side project for building a
Netflix clone where I can apply all the knowledge that I've been learning
throughtout this last year (2021-2022) as a React Front-end Developer. **It's
still a work in progress and it's not finished yet, it's in the early development
stage at this time**.
